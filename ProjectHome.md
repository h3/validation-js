Validate is a small JavaScript form validation library aimed to help me in the process of building rich and responsive web applications. The <a href='http://www.prototypejs.org/'>Prototype framework</a> is needed to make it work.

The point here is not security, you will never achieve security with client side validation and it's a known paradigm. But with the growing popularity of AJAX, this kind of validation has it's place I think.

This library should be used to enrich the user experience by minimizing server requests and processing, NOT to do actual security. In other words, if you don't double check user inputs on the server side, your website or application will be at risk.
