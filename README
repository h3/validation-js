== validate.js ~ 0.8 (rev. 6)

    Validate is a small JavaScript form validation library aimed to 
help me in the process of building rich and responsive web applications.
The Prototype framework is needed to make it work. (www.prototypejs.org)

The point here is not security, you will never achieve security with client 
side validation and it's a known paradigm. But with the growing popularity 
of ajax, this kind of validation has it's place I think.

== Installation/Usage

You can include the script has you would usually do, just put those tag
in the head of your page:

 <script src="/javascripts/prototype.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
 <script src="/javascripts/validate.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

Tip: You can easily integrate to the scriptaculous javascript framework
     and take advantage of their dynamic inclusion capabilities.
     Note that you will have to modify the scriptaculous.js file.
